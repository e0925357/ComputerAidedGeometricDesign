\section{Task 1}
The goal of this task was the computation of the interpolated spline of a set of points. We had a look at three methods for generating the knot vectors: equidistant, Chord and Lee. For the $C^1$-continuity we used FMILL and Bessel to estimate the first order derivation. \\
The different knot vectors are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:knotvec}. The results for the corresponding algorithms can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:compC1Bessel} ($C^1$-continuous case) and \ref{fig:C2} ($C^2$-continuous case). There is not too much difference, but this might be the case because the points are nearly equidistant to their neighbors. \\
The $C^1$-continuous curves for different first derivative estimations can be compared in Figure \ref{fig:compC1Lee}. In our example, the FMILL method looks almost like a polygonal line. The Bessel method produces much rounder transitions, but the lack of $C^2$-continuity is clearly visible. This can be verified in Figure \ref{fig:C1vsC2}, where $C^1$-continuous and $C^2$-continuous spline interpolation are compared directly.
